This is the guidelines I used to setup everything and to run tests:

1) Base folder

On your system create a folder called dev on the root, e.g. C:\dev
2) Install Node.js

Under C:\dev create a new folder called nodejs.
Go to http://nodejs.org/ and install nodejs in the new folder, ensure you include the npm tool in your installation. npm tool installed with nodejs is very old, and needs to be updated. In a command window type "npm install npm -g", -g flag is for global
3) Install nightwatch.js

Under C:\dev create a new folder called nightwatch.
Got to Start > Run > and type 'cmd' to get a console window.
Type npm install nightwatch and note the location and structure of the install.
4) Get Selenium Server

Download "selenium-server-standalone-{latest version}.jar" from; http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
Place the file in the nightwatch/lib folder created as part of the nightwatch.js installation.
Rename the file to sel-serv.jar for ease of reference.
5) File to call the runner

On your system navigate to C:\Dev\nightwatch\node_modules\nightwatch
Create a new file called nightwatch.js
Add the following line and save the file; require('nightwatch/bin/runner.js');
Basic set-up is now complete!

6) Start Selenium

Open a console window (or reuse the one from step 3) and navigate to: C:\Dev\nightwatch\node_modules\nightwatch\lib
Now type java -jar sel-serv.jar to start Selenium Server.
Open Firefox and navigate to http://localhost:4444/ to check the server is up (ignore the 403 error).
7) Run some tests!

Open a new console window.
Navigate to C:\Dev\nightwatch\node_modules\nightwatch\

Run single test by typing node nightwatch.js -t examples/tests/nightwatch.js
NB!!!! Modify path to where your test resides and use the name of your test instead of nightwatch.js (In this case use EntersektAssertionOne.js)




You are now ready to start modifying the installation and adding your own test libraries.

Next steps

Modify your configuration - see how on the website
Set-up your own test libraries and groups - see the main website
Install webdrivers - see the Wiki for details
